Repository of my .dotfile config directory 
===========

**NOTE:** these files are under continuous development and accordingly (some 
parts may have issues of one sort or another...).

**_feel free to peruse and use as you see fit._**

To setup on a new machine:
=========

  * cd "${HOME}"
  * git clone ssh://git@github.com/JAMonschke/.dotfiles.git .
  * cd .dotfiles
  * ./install.sh
